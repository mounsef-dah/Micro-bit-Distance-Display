# Micro:bit Distance Display

This project demonstrates how to measure distance using the GP2Y0A21YK0F sensor and display it on a serial LCD display connected to a Micro:bit microcontroller. The GP2Y0A21YK0F is a compact infrared distance sensor that can detect objects from 10 cm to 80 cm away.

## Features
- Measures distance using the GP2Y0A21YK0F sensor
- Displays the distance in centimeters on a serial LCD display
- Easy-to-use code written in MicroPython
- Configurable sensor output range and display settings

## Installation

1. Connect the GP2Y0A21YK0F sensor to the Micro:bit using the appropriate pins.
1. Connect the serial LCD display to the Micro:bit using the appropriate pins.
1. Copy the code from the GitHub repository and paste it into the Micro:bit code editor.
1. Flash the code to the Micro:bit and power it on.

### Usage

To use the distance display, simply point the GP2Y0A21YK0F sensor at an object and the distance in centimeters will be displayed on the serial LCD display. The code is fully configurable and can be modified to change the sensor output range, display settings, and more.
